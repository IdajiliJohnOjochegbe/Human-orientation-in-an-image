# Introduction

This project aims to build a binary classification model to distinguish between upright and upside-down images. The process involves data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

# Setup
To run this project, you will need:

Google Colab

Google Drive for data storage

Python libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PIL

Mount Google Drive

Mount your Google Drive to access and store the dataset.

from google.colab import drive

drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Data Collection

The data collection phase involves loading images from a specified directory, categorizing them into upright and upside-down images, and saving them into respective folders. Ensure you have at least 2000 images for a balanced dataset.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform EDA to understand the dataset's distribution and characteristics. This includes visualizing sample images and analyzing image size distributions.

# Feature Engineering

Utilize a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from the images. This involves loading images, preprocessing them, and using the model to obtain feature vectors.

# Model Training

Train a binary classification model using the extracted features. The model architecture includes a pre-trained ResNet50 base, followed by custom dense layers for binary classification.

Steps:

Freeze pre-trained layers of ResNet50.

Add custom dense layers.

Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function.

Train the model using the ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and loading.

# Results

Evaluate the model's performance based on accuracy and loss metrics. Plot the training and validation accuracy to visualize the model's learning progress over epochs.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of image classification from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The ResNet50 model successfully distinguishes between upright and upside-down images with high accuracy.
